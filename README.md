# RISC-V

RISC-V Processor Implementation as a part of computer architecture university course. The implementation is pipelined with correct hazard handling. The project is implemented entirely in Verilog, simulated using Vivado, and ran on FPGA. Also, thorough testing was conducted for all supported instructions and possible hazards.
